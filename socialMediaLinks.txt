Whether it's taking something apart or tinkering with a device, my mind stays on tech. I have always been drawn to understand how things work and its implementation with others. Through my curiosity, my passion is to create.

One medium that has helped me and my creative process is photography. Being behind the lens has provided me with a better perspective of the world and what is possible. Through taking photos I have learned that it is best to follow your interests.

My inspiration strives through a number of ways, one technology. I have seen that tech can be used for a means for communication, entertainment, and growth, and my dream is to innovate and produce compelling technology.

In pursuit of my passion I decided to major in Electrical Engineering at the University of San Diego. I have come to find myself heavily invested in my classes and extracurriculars activities across campus. Being apart of the National Society of Black Engineers and Student Alumni Association, time management is key.

At the moment most of my time is invested in my class work, Student organizations and photography. Although, after graduating in 2018, I plan to start my own company centered at the cultivation of technology. Some of my inspiration arises from the Little Black Pearl center in the Kenwood neighborhood, of Chicago.  

Most of the focus will be toward the youth, providing them the space to be as creative as they want to be.
